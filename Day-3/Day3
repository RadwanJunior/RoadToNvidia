Dot product example:

inputs = [1, 2, 3, 2.5]

weights= [[0.2,0.8,-0.5],
          [0.5,-0.91,0.26, -0.5],
          [-0.26,-0.27, 0.17, 0.87]]

biases = [2,3,0.5]

output = np.dot(weights, inputs) + biases
print(output)

What happens in this example?
- The inputs vector is multiplied by the first list in the weights array, then the 2nd, then the 3rd
- This returns a vector of [x1,x2,x3] corresponding to the number of lists in the weight array
- This is then added to the biases[] vector which is also in format [x1,x2,x3] to get a result
 
What is a batch?
- A 2D array or Matrix that has is a list of sublists. An example is a Shape(8,4) which means a list of sublists, and each sublist holds 4 values

Weight vs bias?
- Two different ways of approximating something.

The whole idea of inputs, weights and biases is very similiar to the case of y=mx+b. Where
the input is dot product with the weights and the biases is added to offset

What is an activatoin point?
- Adjusting weights is completely different than when adjusting biases (which is somewhat pattern like movement)
