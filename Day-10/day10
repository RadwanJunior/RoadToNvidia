Started studying Probability and Statistics as it is a large part of machine learning and AI, will be taking notes of work here:

Set Theory:
- ![alt text](image.png)
- Intersection: A ∧ B -> all elements in both A and B -> event that both A and B occur (Also AB) -> AB == BA
- Union: A ∨ B -> all elements in A and B (no elements repeated twice) -> event that either event A or B or both occurs (Also A or B, inclusive) -> A or B == B or A ---- ![alt text](image-9.png)
- Complement: A′ -> All elements not in A

De morgan's laws in probability:
- ![alt text](image-1.png)

- (A ∨ B)′ -> everything not in A or B == A′ ∧ B′ -> everything not in A and not in B
- ![alt text](image-2.png) -> first law visualized with set theory

- (A ∧ B)′ -> everything not in both A and B == A′ ∧ B′ -> everything not in A or not in B
- ![alt text](image-3.png)-> first law visualized with set theory

Example including set theory, de morgan's laws:
- ![alt text](image-4.png)

Example 2:
- ![alt text](image-5.png) -> wording is very important to understanding the problem and the set theory diagrams for it

De morgan's law can make difficult questions much easier given the information in the question:

Examples of de morgan's laws on 3 Sets instead of 2:

What does it mean that 2 sets are mutually exclusive:
- ![alt text](image-8.png)
- When 2 sets dont share any elements in the sample space -> this means that none of the elements in their sets happen at the same time -> meaning they are mutually exclusive
- AKA disjoint events

What is the addition rule:
- Helps us find the probability of the union of two events
- ![alt text](image-10.png) -> subtract the A ∧ B to remove the duplicate addition

Special Addition rule/ME addition rule:
- ![alt text](image-11.png) -> used when both sets don't share elements from the sample space at the same time

Notation of A′:
- ![alt text](image-12.png)

Relation of A and A′:
- ![alt text](image-13.png) -> A and A′ are ME events (they can't both happen at the same time/ don't share elements from the sample space at the same time)

Calculating probability of an event given the sample space:

Calculating complement of Set's probability:

Pairwise intersection:
- Intersections of Events given a sample space set
- ![alt text](image-16.png) -> E ∧ G are both ME

Calculating union of sets in 2 different ways:
- ![alt text](image-17.png)

Example given:
- ![alt text](image-18.png) -> ![alt text](image-19.png) -> ![alt text](image-20.png)

Example for venn diagrams given 3 events:
- ![alt text](image-21.png) -> ![alt text](image-22.png) -> ![alt text](image-23.png)

Permutations and combinations:
- ![alt text](image-24.png)

Permutation vs Combination:
- Order matters for permutation whereas doesn’t matter for combination. Ex ab, ba is 2 for permutation but is 1 for combination.

Introduction to conditional probability:
- P(2|Even) -> Probability it is a 2 given the reduced sample space is only even numbers from the Main sample space ![alt text](image-26.png)

Conditional Probability definition:
- ![alt text](image-27.png)

Example of conditional probability:
- ![alt text](image-28.png) -> ![alt text](image-29.png)

Example 2:
- ![alt text](image-30.png)

Example 3:
- ![alt text](image-31.png)

Example 4:
- ![alt text](image-32.png) -> ![alt text](image-33.png)
- In this case since knowing this "given" information does not affect the elements being sampled -> it is independet events
