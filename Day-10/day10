Started studying Probability and Statistics as it is a large part of machine learning and AI, will be taking notes of work here:

Set Theory:
- ![alt text](image.png)
- Intersection: A ∧ B -> all elements in both A and B
- Union: A ∨ B -> all elements in A and B (no elements repeated twice)
- Complement: A′ -> All elements not in A

De morgan's laws in probability:
- ![alt text](image-1.png)

- (A ∨ B)′ -> everything not in A or B == A′ ∧ B′ -> everything not in A and not in B
- ![alt text](image-2.png) -> first law visualized with set theory

- (A ∧ B)′ -> everything not in both A and B == A′ ∧ B′ -> everything not in A or not in B
- ![alt text](image-3.png)-> first law visualized with set theory

Example including set theory, de morgan's laws:
