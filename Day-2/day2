Dot product is used to multiply 2 vectors together element-wise

Example we are given:


The result of the dot product on 2 vectors is a single scalar multiple.

In 1x1 dotproduct it didn't matter for us which list was passed in which argument for the dot() function, but it will matter later when we use different examples

Order of weights, inputs passed to dot() matters as weights is a matrix. Meaning the returned output by the dot product will be at least 3 by x. In this case inputs is a 1d array so the returned value will be 3x1

Need to understand atomic calculations done by dot product to avoid weird shape errors in dot() functions
