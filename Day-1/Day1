I noticed that the main skills to focus on are: Python, Tensorflow, C++ and CUDA.

I planned on working on developing my Python Skills first. I plan to do this through learning about how to create a neural network from scratch in Python:

General Idea of a neural netowrk:
![alt text](image.png)
- Every unique input and ever unique neuron with associated weights are summed together per neuron plus a bias
- Then it is run through an activation funtion which is done for every layer -> output information
- Calculate a loss (how wrong the neural network is to fix it)

Idea of a loss function in code:

Goal of neural networks:
- Take input data and produce output data that is desired

Training the weights and biases is what the training process actually is

![alt text](image-2.png)
- The connections between 1 circle(neuron) to the other is a weight
- Every neuron is a unique bias
- Each parameter's output impacts the next neuron and overall output

Let's code a nueron:
Check p1.py

inputs = [1,2,3]
weights = [0.2,0.8,-0.5]
bias = 2

output = inputs[0]*weights[0] + inputs[1]*weights[1] + inputs[2]*weights[2] + bias
print(output)

We have coded a single neuron that takes in 3 input values, and their weights and has a certain bias on the output. Computes the output

What is an input to a neuron?
- An actual input from the input layer, being stored in a vector. Could be like input from a sensor for example
- Outputs from other neurons being passed into this neuron

The next thing is to model a layer
- This was just done by modeeling a couple of neurons that each have their own biases, inputs and weights

Stay tuned for arrays vs tensors?

Move from python list to a more standardized way of implementing neurons and their outputs in vectors -> moving to more dynamic code as well

Zip() - combines 2 lists into a list of lists -> used in this case to combine the weights and biases

Weights and biases are like knobs that tune the prediction

Bias is not different from y=mx+b, where it offsets the output

What is shape?
- At each dimension, what is the size at that dimension

Shape is (2,4) means it is a 2D array or list -> with 4 elements in each sublist

What is a homologous list?
- Same size for each dimension

If we don't have a homologous list, we cant determine dimension

![alt text](image-6.png)

Shape(3,2,4) means there is a big list with 3 sublists and each sublist has 4 elements each

What is a tensor?
- Object that can be represented as an array

To multiply the inputs array by the weights matrix, we can use the dot product
